# CarX Real Car Names
Replaces CarX car names with their real life counterparts.

## Info
> is there a mod available to get the actual names of the cars  
instead of the off brand aldi versions  
~ Adthefum1#9823

Yes! This mod aims to replace all the car names with their actual real life counterparts.

All names are pulled from the `names.txt` file within this repo, the mod will fetch the file on each game start so in the event that names are changed or added, all you should need to do is restart your game. You should only ever redownload the mod if the changelog specifies it's a mod update and not a name update.

## Installation
1) Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Hi-ImKyle/CarX-Real-Car-Names/releases/latest)
2) Place `CarNames.dll` in `CarX Drift Racing Online\BepInEx\plugins`
3) Open CarX Drift Racing

# Setting type: String

```

### "Why are there car names that aren't in the game?!?!?!?"
Some names, such as `Thor 8800` and `Owl`, are disabled cars within the game.
### "Can I drive them?!?!?!?"
Sure you can select these vehicles, but you will probably crash going into a lobby. I have tried using them, only 1 works and it's already in the game.
### "BUT I WANT THEM?!?!?!?"
If the demand is high enough, I'll make a mod to enable all vehicles. It's really not worth it as only 1 vehicle has a model and I've already mentioned that it's got a normal enabled car within the game already anyway.
